## Project Overview

The IPL Win Prediction project predicts the outcome of cricket matches based on several features such as the batting team, bowling team, current run rate (CRR), required run rate (RRR), and others. The model is built using Logistic Regression, and the web application is developed using Streamlit and deployed on Heroku.
